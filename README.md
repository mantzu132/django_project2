# django-project
This project is a blogging platform developed using Django.

## Key Features
* **User Registration and Profile Management**: The project allows new users to register and create their accounts. Once registered, users can update their profile information and profile pictures. User authentication is handled by Django's built-in authentication system.

* **Post Creation, Viewing, Updating, and Deletion**: Registered users can create new blog posts. Each post contains a title, content, posting date, and author. Posts can be viewed by anyone visiting the site. The authors of the posts also have the ability to update or delete their posts. All of the data is stored in a SQLite database.

* **User-specific Post Viewing**: The platform allows visitors to view posts by specific authors.

* **Post Pagination**: The home view displays posts with pagination, showing a fixed number of posts per page.

* **Signals**: Django signals are used to automatically create a profile for a user upon registration and save it.

* **Pillow** : Pillow, a Python Imaging Library (PIL), is used for handling image files in user profiles.

* **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is used in templates to create a responsive and attractive user interface.

This project was built as part of my learning process, following the guidance of a popular Django tutorial by Corey Schafer available on YouTube
